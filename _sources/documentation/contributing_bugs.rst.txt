Contributing / Reporting Bugs
-----------------------------

You want to contribute to vimiv? Great! Feel free to take a look at the
:ref:`contributing` for more details and a few tips on how to get
started.

The best way to report bugs is to open an
`issue on github <https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/issues/>`_. If you do
not have a github account, feel free to
`contact me directly <karlch@protonmail.com>`_. If possible, please reproduce
the bug running ``vimiv --log-level debug`` and include the log file located in
``$XDG_DATA_HOME/vimiv/vimiv.log`` where ``$XDG_DATA_HOME`` is usually
``~/.local/share/`` if you have not configured it.
