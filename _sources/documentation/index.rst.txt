Getting help
------------

You can contact me under `my email address <karlch@protonmail.com>`_ or
open an `issue on github <https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/issues/>`_ if you
think the question is of general interest.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

The best way to report bugs is to open an
`issue on github <https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/issues/>`_. If you do
not have a github account, feel free to
`contact me directly <karlch@protonmail.com>`_. If possible, please include the
log file located in ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/vimiv/vimiv.log`` where ``$XDG_DATA_HOME``
is usually ``~/.local/share/`` if you have not configured it.
