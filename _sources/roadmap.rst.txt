Roadmap
=======

In the current beta-phase, a minor release is planned roughly every month. Once the
minor release has reached version 0.10 and there are no more major bugs remaining, the
gtk version can be replaced as default. After replacing the gtk version, some time of
stabilizing and switching will be required before releasing version 1.0 can be
considered. Once this has happened, vimiv should strictly apply `semantic versioning
<https://semver.org/>`_.

The Gtk version will retrieve critical bugfixes at least until version 1.0 has been
released. No new features will be implemented there, though.
