.. warning:: This website is WIP.

   The repository for vimiv-qt is still private as the code is not yet
   completed. As soon as it goes public, this website will be completed as
   well. Thank you for your patience.


Vimiv is an image viewer with vim-like keybindings. It is written in python3
using the Qt5 toolkit and is free software, licensed under the GPL. Some of the
features are:

* Simple library browser
* Thumbnail mode
* Basic image editing
* Command line with tab completion
* Complete customization with style sheets

For information on how to get vimiv running take a look at
:doc:`the installation instructions <documentation/install>`. Afterwards, this
is a good place to :doc:`get started <documentation/getting_started>`.
For more information please check out the
:doc:`documentation <documentation/index>`.
