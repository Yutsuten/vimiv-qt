Vimiv provides configurable settings.

There are two ways to change a setting:

* Update the configuration file to change it permanently
* Run the ``:set`` command to change it temporarily

The configuration file is ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vimiv/vimiv.conf`` where
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is usually ``~/.config/`` if you have not updated it.

The following table explains all available settings.
